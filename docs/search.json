    "text": "In summer 2010, I was walking by the (now closed) pet store in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, and I fell in love with a puppy in the window. There was something about her and somehow I knew right away that she was special and that I needed to get her right that second. She was the best impulse purchase of my life and she turned out to be the most amazing, lovable and gentle creature one could imagine. Kiki was absolutely perfect and we loved her more than anything.\n    She moved with us across country (and then came back), flew on a plane to visit her grandparents in Arizona for Christmases and birthdays, and traveled internationally (OK, we drove with her to Canada a few times, but it still counts). When she got sick and could not longer walk far, we got a stroller to take her on walks because she loved being outside and she loved people watching. She was a fighter - once she was given 6 months to live and she made it into 2 years and we fought for her each and every extra day.\n    It’s been 1 year, 1 month, and 19 days since she’s been gone but I love her just as much and I know I always will."

Between 2002 and 2023, it gained 9 percentage points in relative share, going from 68.1% of total to 76.6% of total, respectively.\nAt the same time, there has been a corresponding decrease in Bus trips.
